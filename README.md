# Wallpapers By Distro
This is just a repo of wallpapers for Linux distributions. I am working on getting wallpapers for all distributions that make sense (i.e Debian, Arch Linux, Void, etc.)
Once I get at least one design I'll work on a different sets of wallpapers.

Eventually I might have the wherewithall to add dotfiles for each wallpaper to optomize the look and feel of the desktop, but I'm mainly focused on wallpapers for now.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not going to even pretend like I am good at graphic design, and I'm just doing this for kicks. While most of these are good (at least from my perspective) they aren't particularly high quality to the average viewer.  


# Slogans

A few notes about distro slogans:

- Many distributions have an "Official" slogan (i.e. EndeavorOS, OpenSUSE, Void) 

- Others have a community which has created their own ideal slogan for the distro (i.e. Arch, Gentoo).  

- If neither are present I will find one that makes sense based on what I know about the distro

- I will have used 

     1.) the official slogan
     
     2.) the most supported slogan I see from the community
    
     3.) determine what might be the best based on my knowledge of the distro

In that order, as to ensure the best slogan is used.  Because of the uncertain science of #2 and #3, you are welcome to email me (comradespider1@protonmail.com) suggestions or send me edits of the original files I have included in the main branch, so I can apply to proper changes.

That said, this applies explicitly to corrective measures.  Any other changes (font, styling, etc) will not be considered, as the design will not change, only the lettering.  If you would like to submit these types edits please see below.


# Content Submission

I will be using a Fork and Pull model of repo, so any changes you would like to add (new designs, dotfiles, etc.) must be done on your own fork of this project, and then a pull request must be submitted. 

Me or an aforementioned trusted source will review the changes and if accepted, will merge it into an appropriate folder on the main branch, and will credit you in the design description file (i.e. Graff/graff.txt).  Please note that any work submitted will automatically fall under the Creative Commons License, you may read this in the main branch of this file, if you so wish.
