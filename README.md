# wallpapers-by-distro
This is just a repo of wallpapers for Linux distributions. I am working on getting wallpapers for all distributions that make sense (i.e Debian, Arch Linux, Void, etc.)
Once I get past that I'll work on a different sets of wallpapers.

Eventually I might have the wherewithall to add dotfiles for each wallpaper to optomize the look and feel of the desktop, but I'm mainly focused on wallpapers for now.

If you would like to add anything along these lines to the repo, just let me know.  I have put my email on my profile.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not going to even pretend like I am good at graphic design, and I'm just doing this for kicks. While most of these are good, at least from my perspective, they aren't particularly high quality to the average viewer.

Thanks for your time,
